    <h1>Dr Marika Sosnowski</h1>
    <p>
      Marika Sosnowski is an Australian-qualified lawyer, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Melbourne Law School and a
      Research Associate at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA) in Hamburg. She works as a legal
      anthropologist with primary research interests in the fields of critical security studies (mainly ceasefires),
      local/rebel governance and legal systems (particularly issues around citizenship and belonging).
    </p>
    <p>
      From June 2023 until May 2026 she is based in the Peter McMullin Centre on Statelessness at Melbourne Law School
      working on a postdoctoral project which examines the legal after-life of war and revolution. The project aims to
      better understand how people internalise and experience the law at an everyday level after mass violence or
      world-shaping events. Outputs for this project includes a creative non-fiction book, various academic journal and
      public-facing articles (including a piece shortlisted for the 2024 <a href="https://www.melbourneprize.org/finalists/" >Melbourne Writers
      Prize</a>) as well as a podcast.
